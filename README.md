# The Green Neighbor Project
This is a collaborative, capstone project done for a client as a part of Prime Digital Academy.

70% of households in the US have access to green energy programs, but utility companies have no incentive to publicize that information. Our client has been aggregating information about these programs along with his research team and wants to create a web application that makes that information easily accessible to the public.

## Project Goals
The end product will be a public facing website and an admin management page. Users will be able to enter in their zip code, view energy programs near them, and then be redirected to those program websites to sign up. This will be combined with connections to social media to spread awareness as well as opportunities for users to contribute to the project by supplying information.

The admin page will be a control panel for managing information about utility companies and energy programs they offer. The admin page will also be able to review crowdsources information from users.
